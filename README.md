# TheMealsApp

![This a demo gif for TheMealsApp](https://github.com/royce-git/TheMealsApp/blob/master/demo/TheMealsApp.gif)

This is a project I created using a Udemy course combined with the skills I developed at Stockholms School of Applied Technology. 

It is a small recipe app made using React-Native, React Redux and Expo.

This is an ongoing project that I plan to use everyday with my partner to build our own recipe library.

Any great recipes out there missing please let me know :D
